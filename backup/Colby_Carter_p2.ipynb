    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "(a) Nearest neighbors does not perform well for this problem because the features are not continuous numeric values. Instead, the presence of a word for a given observation is captured by a one, if not a zero. So, all distance computations are either one or zero, which is a low level of precision for determining a nearest neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Because Naive Bayes assumes independence between the features, the model is not penalized for maximizing the number of word features. Logistic, on the other hand, likely suffers from overfitting by having more features than observations by an order of magnitude. These features likely add noise to the test label predictions, causing the higher error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) The parameter C is the Inverse of regularization strength, so the more regularized coefficients are desired, the lower the value for C needs to be. Thus, the relationship between the C and the sum of the squared weights is positive, where a smaller value for C reduces the size and thus the influence of the coefficients."

The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
